A fully functioning, playable Pac-Man game.

About:
I developed this for my A-Level AQA Non Exam Assessment 2017.
The project was created in Visual Basic 2012 with no additional 3rd party plugins.

The assets are currently loaded from the debug folder, so if not running from debug, copy the assets to release.
When I get time, I will hopefully update the project to include the assets as internal resouces.
